   ssociated with field data information. It makes also possible to visualise quick information recorded by levels, square or spit.
   This is an open and free software, 

`microTRI` has an easily accessible interface, allowing to record data in Excel
files (XLS respectively). The application includes functions to
visualize premiliminary data as Bioclim estimation, rarefaction curves, taphonomical proportions.
